# Stochastic-Modeling


- This repository consists of cases on Queueing Theory and Markov Chains.
 
- For each case, a summary of the problem and the given parameters are included as a pdf document in the corresponding files.

- Additional documents used for modelling are also attached.

- The cases are solved with Stochastic Modelling approach using MATLAB.
